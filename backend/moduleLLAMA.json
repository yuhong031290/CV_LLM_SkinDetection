People tend to get more of them as they get older.\n\nSeborrheic keratoses are usually brown, black or light tan. The growths (lesions) look waxy or scaly and slightly raised. They appear gradually, usually on the face, neck, chest or back.\n\nSeborrheic keratoses are harmless and not contagious. They don't need treatment, but you may decide to have them removed if they become irritated by clothing or you don't like how they look."

        "output": "Systemic mastocytosis is a rare disorder that results in too many mast cells building up in your body. A mast cell is a type of white blood cell. Mast cells are found in connective tissues throughout your body. Mast cells help your immune system function properly and normally help protect you from disease.\n\nWhen you have systemic mastocytosis, excess mast cells build up in your skin, bone marrow, digestive tract or other body organs. When triggered, these mast cells release substances that can cause signs and symptoms similar to those of an allergic reaction and, sometimes, severe inflammation that may result in organ damage. Common triggers include alcohol, spicy foods, insect stings and certain medications."

Too many mast cells can build up in the skin, liver, spleen, bone marrow or intestines. Less commonly, other organs such as the brain, heart or lungs also may be affected.\n\nSigns and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis may include:\n\n- Flushing, itching or hives\n- Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting\n- Anemia or bleeding disorders\n- Bone and muscle pain\n- Enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes\n- Depression, mood changes or problems concentrating\n\nThe mast cells are triggered to produce substances that cause inflammation and symptoms. People have different triggers, but the most common ones include:\n\n- Alcohol\n- Skin irritation\n- Spicy foods\n- Exercise\n- Insect stings\n- Certain medications"

Ringworm gets its name because of its appearance. No worm is involved. Ringworm of the body is related to athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris) and ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis). Ringworm often spreads by direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person or animal.\n\nMild ringworm often responds to antifungal medications applied to the skin. For more-severe infections, you may need to take antifungal pills for several weeks."

Hives can be triggered by many situations and substances, including certain foods and medications.\n\nAngioedema can arise with hives or alone. It causes swelling in the deeper layers of skin, often around the face and lips. Short-lived (acute) hives and angioedema are common. Most times, they are harmless, clear up within a day and don't leave any lasting marks, even without treatment. Hives that last longer than six weeks are called chronic hives.\n\nHives and angioedema are usually treated with antihistamine medication. Angioedema can be life-threatening if swelling of the tongue or in the throat blocks the airway."

If blood flow is restricted, it can result in organ and tissue damage.\n\nThere are many types of vasculitis, and most of them are rare. Vasculitis might affect just one organ, or several. The condition can be short term or long lasting.\n\nVasculitis can affect anyone, though some types are more common among certain age groups.

Giant cell arteritis can cause double vision and temporary or permanent blindness in one or both eyes, sometimes being the first sign of the disease.\n- **Hands or feet:** Numbness or weakness in a hand or foot. Swelling or hardening of the palms and soles.\n- **Lungs:** Shortness of breath or coughing up blood if vasculitis affects the lungs.\n- **Skin:** Red spots from bleeding under the skin, lumps, or open sores."

If the bumps are scratched or injured, the infection can spread to nearby skin. Molluscum contagiosum also spreads through person-to-person contact and contact with infected objects.\n\nThough most common in children, molluscum contagiosum can affect adults as well — particularly those with weakened immune systems. Adults with a healthy immune system can develop molluscum contagiosum from sexual activity with an infected partner.\n\nLeft untreated, the bumps usually disappear in 6 months to 2 years."
